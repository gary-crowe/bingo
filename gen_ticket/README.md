# Various code snippets I found/modified to generate a bingo ticket
| File      | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| chits.py | Generates output to a file |
| test2.py | Generates output using list - will use for now |
| test3.py | uses an np construct. Probably way to go but how do I pass that using messaging? |
| tst.py | Uses nice output formating - might be useful |
| american.py | Generates an American bingo card |
| test5.py | Variation, interesting formatting |
